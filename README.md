I wanted to see how far I can push it, having dabbled with Clojure/-Script for a few weeks after work.

So, there you have it: _**an example of an artisinal (most probably bad ü´†) NodeJS-independent Frontend Project üçª üòé**_

> \- everyone not writing lisp

well, if you thought [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) was cool, but you struggled with the types... or maybe you think types hinder from greatness... [Rich never said this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V1FtfBDsLU&t=2227s), but I heard it anyways in his talks.

## What you have at hand, when going through this codebase

- firing and receiving a http json request
  - json extraction
  - process data, extract information
- dynamic data binding / state management
- DOM creation/manipulation
- state management
- very basic Browser Event Management
  - user interaction
  - filtering
- parameterized build for dev/prod scenarios

## Run with Docker üê≥

`$ docker build . -t clj-events-spa`  
`$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 clj-events-spa`

then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Pre-Conditions (if you want to get your hands dirty üëè)

- have [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) installed
- skim this page about quick starting ClojureScript: https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start
- [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl)

_I code clojure in VS Code using_ [VSCode with Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) or a similar Editor supporting Clojure(-Script)

## Compile the sources and view them

`./build-production.sh` and then http-serve the files

I solve that task using [node's http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)  
other may use [Python for that](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)

## What's good, what could be easily improved, what did I learn?

#### improvements needed

- state management abstraction, faster filtering may (see medium low hanging fruits)

#### medium low hanging fruits

- lookup table for the calendar events
- memoizing results ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### what was learned

- clojure(-script) isn't witchcraft and has some really nice docs/api/reference
- almost no dependencies needed ü§Ø
- one language to rule them all

## Development (with VSCode and Calva)

- start a REPL `deps.edn + ClojureScript build for Browser`
- a Browser will open, then
- evaluate `core.cljs` line by line 
- evaluate requirements in `events.cljs` and inspect the events in state
